## Usage

Canvas-sync requires logging in to your canvas account. There are 2 authentication methods:

### Access token (stable, recommended for most users)

  1. Access tokens allow canvas-sync to interact with canvas without logging in. To create an access token, head to your [canvas settings](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/profile/settings) (note: this link is for nus students, for non-nus students head to `<your school canvas website>/profile/settings`)
  2. Click the "New access token" button and enter "canvas-sync" in the "Purpose" field. Make sure to leave the "Expires" field **blank**

  ![second](examples/access_token_walkthrough_2.png)
  ![third](examples/access_token_walkthrough_3.png)

  3. Create a config file with

  ```bash
  canvas-sync init
  ```
  
  4. Copy the token value displayed and paste it in the `~/.canvas-sync/config.yaml` file as below

  ```bash
  # paste your access token below
  access_token: # <paste your access token>
  # replace with your preferred location to store canvas data
  data_dir: $HOME/.canvas-sync/data
  # replace with your canvas url
  canvas_url: https://canvas.nus.edu.sg
  ```

### Log in (unstable)

  1. Log in to your canvas account on your browser (chrome preferred)
  2. That's it! You can run one of the command from [here](#commands)
  3. Note: you might be prompted to log in to your canvas account from time to time

## Config

All configuration is done in the `$HOME/.canvas-sync/config.yaml` file.

3 values can be configured:

- `access_token`: token generated by the canvas user (you) to download from canvas directly, if not filled canvas-sync will prompt you to log in
- `data_dir`: directory to store downloaded canvas data, defaults to `$HOME/.canvas-sync/data`  
- `canvas_url`: URL of your target canvas site, defaults to `https://canvas.nus.edu.sg`

To create a default config file, run `canvas-sync init`

## Commands

### Init

Creates a new config file in the default directory `~/.canvas-sync`
